   <details><summary> Overview of VLSI Design </summary> 
   
   #### **Overview of VLSI Design**
   
* **Packaged Chip:**
    * Different types of packaging are available (SIP, DIP, QFN, BGA etc)
    * The central part of the chip is call die
    * Integrated circuits are put into protective packages to allow easy handling and assembly onto printed circuit boards and to protect the devices from damage
    * Integrated circuit packaging is the last assembly process before testing and shipping devices to customers.

* **Die and Wafer:**
    * A die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated
    * Generally the die size is 1mm X 1mm or 1mm X 2mm.
    * All the components fabricated on the die
    * Wafer is the round slice of silicon that the individual die (chips) are printed on. Before processing, it’s shiny and clear.
    * The wafer is cut (diced) into many pieces, each containing one copy of the circuit. Each of these pieces is called a die.
    * The wafer diameter is around 12 inch ~ 300 mm.
    * A Single wafer contains 10’s of thousands die

   #### **VLSI**
      
   ##### **What is VLSI technology?**
* **Very-large-scale integration (VLSI)** is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining millions or billions of transistors into a single chip
* VLSI is a successor to large-scale integration (LSI), medium-scale integration (MSI) and small-scale integration (SSI) technologies   

      
##### **What is VLSI mainly used for?**

   </details>



   <details><summary> Moore's Law </summary>
      
#### **Moore's Law**
      
* **Moore's Law**- states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. We can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase       every two years because of this, yet we will pay less for them.  
      
*  In 1965, Gordon Moore predicted that transistors would continue to shrink.
   * Doubled transistor density every 2 year
   * Doubled performance density every 2 year

**2. Which semiconductor material used mostly for IC design and why?**
      
* Silicon is the most widely used semiconductor material as it is more efficient in producing high-speed integrated circuits. It can be used as either an insulator (doesn't allow electricity to flow) or a semiconductor (allows a little flow of electricity). This is important for making chips and very cheap. Silicon elements are able to bind atoms tightly and in complex arrangements. The abundance of silicon makes it inexpensive and easy to acquire. 




**3. What is the difference between Silicon and Germanium?**
      
|         Silicon          |     Germanium      |
|  -------------    | ------------- |
|  Silicon is the chemical element present in periodic table with atomic number 14 and represented as Si  |     Germanium is the chemical element present in the periodic table with atomic number 32 and represented as Ge      |
|       The atomic radius is smaller compared with Germanium because of smaller atomic number    |     The atomic radius is larger compared with Silicon      | 
|  Silicons are less conductive than Germanium    | Germanium is more conductive in nature |
|  Silicons are used as semiconductors as they can withstand up to higher temperature ranges.   |  Germanium cannot be used as semiconductors as they have a certain limit to temperatures  |




**5. What is doping? What are the different types of trivalent and pentavalent impurity materials?**

* **Doping**
   * **Doping** is the process of adding impurities to intrinsic semiconductors to alter their properties. 
   * The conductivity of metal is increased by adding an appropriate amount of suitable impurity. This process is known as doping. 
   * It can be performed with an impurity that is electron-rich or electron-deficient than the intrinsic semiconductor silicon or germanium.


* **Pentavalent impurities**
   * **Pentavalent impurities** are the atoms with five valence electrons used for the doping of semiconductors. 
   * For example: Arsenic (As), Phosphorous (Pi), Antimony (Sb)

* **Trivalent impurities** 
   * **Trivalent impurities** are called Acceptor impurities. Since the trivalent atoms, an element whose each atom has 3 valence electrons is called Trivalent impurity. 
   * For example: Indium ,Gallium,Aluminium,Boron
   
   


**7. What is PN junction? How it behaves without any external bias voltage?**

* A P-N junction is an interface or a boundary between two semiconductor material types, namely the p-type and the n-type, inside a semiconductor. In a semiconductor,   the P-N junction is created by the method of doping.

* Zero Bias – No external voltage potential is applied to the PN junction diode.
  * When a diode is Zero Biased no external energy source is applied and a natural Potential Barrier is developed across a depletion layer which is approximately 0.5       to 0.7v for silicon diodes and approximately 0.3 of a volt for germanium diodes.
  
  * in zero bias or thermal equilibrium state junction potential provides higher potential energy to the holes on the P-side than the N-side. If the terminals of           junction diode are shorted, few majority charge carriers (holes) in the P side with sufficient energy to surmount the potential barrier travel across the depletion     region
  
  * Therefore, with the help of holes, current starts to flow in the diode and it is referred to as forward current. In the similar manner, holes in the N side move       across the depletion region in reverse direction and the current generated in this fashion is referred to as reverse current.
  
  * The potential barrier that now exists discourages the diffusion of any more majority carriers across the junction. However, the potential barrier helps minority       carriers (few free electrons in the P-region and few holes in the N-region) to drift across the junction.
  
  * Then an “Equilibrium” or balance will be established when the majority carriers are equal and both moving in opposite directions, so that the net result is zero       current flowing in the circuit. When this occurs the junction is said to be in a state of “Dynamic Equilibrium“.
  
  * The minority carriers are constantly generated due to thermal energy so this state of equilibrium can be broken by raising the temperature of the PN junction           causing an increase in the generation of minority carriers, thereby resulting in an increase in leakage current but an electric current cannot flow since no           circuit has been connected to the PN junction

**8. What is built-in potential of a P-N junction?**

* The built-in potential of a P N junction diode is 0.7 V at room temperature




**13. What is BJT and how it is different from the diode?**

**18. What are the different types of MOSFET?**

* **MOSFETs has two classes:**
   * Enhancement mode
   * Depletion mode
   
* Each class is available as n-channel or p-channel, hence overall they tally up to four types of MOSFETs.
   * n-channel Depletion Mode
   * p-channel Depletion Mode
   * n-channel Enhancement Mode
   * p-channel Enhancement Mode

* **Depletion Mode**
When there is no voltage across the gate terminal, the channel shows maximum conductance. When the voltage across the gate terminal is either positive or negative, then the channel conductivity decreases.

* **Enhancement Mode**
When there is no voltage across the gate terminal, then the device does not conduct. When there is the maximum voltage across the gate terminal, then the device shows enhanced conductivity.

   <details><summary> CMOS Fabrication Process Step </summary>

   #### **CMOS Fabrication Process Step**
   
   * ##### **Process Steps:**
   1. wafer formation (sand-to-silicon)
   
   <details><summary> wafer formation (sand-to-silicon) </summary>
   
  * The basic raw material used in CMOS fabs is a wafer or disk of silicon, roughly 75 mm to 300 mm (12 inch) in diameter and less than 1 mm thick
  * Pure silicon is melted in a pot at 1400º C. 
  * A small seed containing the desired crystal orientation is inserted into molten silicon and slowly (1mm/minute) pulled out. 
  * The silicon crystal is manufactured as a cylindrical ingot. 
  * This cylinder is sawed into discs or wafers. Polishing and crystal orientation takes place later on.
   
   </details>
   
   
   
   2. Photolithography
   
   <details><summary> Photolithography </summary>
   
  * The wafer is coated with the photoresist and subjected to selective illumination through the photomask 
  * A photomask is constructed with chromium (chrome) covered quartz glass. A UV light source is used to expose the photoresist
  * It uses ultraviolet light and photomask to transfer the image from the photomask to the layer
  * Photoresist that is sensitive to light allows the pattern underneath to be selectively exposed or selectively protected
  * A developer solvent is then used to dissolve the soluble unexposed photoresist, leaving islands of insoluble exposed photoresist
  
   </details>
   
   
   
   3. Well and Channel Formation
   
   <details><summary> Well and Channel Formation </summary>
   
  * There are 4 CMOS technology processes
     * N-well process
     * P-well process
     * Twin-well process
     * Triple-well process

   </details>
   
   
   
   4. Silicon Dioxide 
   
   <details><summary> Silicon Dioxide </summary>
   
  * **Wet Oxidation**: when the oxidizing atmosphere contains water vapor.
    * for thick oxide (field oxide)
    * Fast growth rate (140 - 250 A/h)
    * The temperature is usually between 900 °C and 1000 °C
    * use for masking oxide and the LOCOS oxide
    * Higher defect
    
  * **Dry Oxidation**: when the oxidizing atmosphere is pure oxygen
    * best for thin oxide (less than 1000 A)
    * Slow growth rate (140 - 250 A/h)
    * Temperatures are in the region of 1200 °C to achieve an acceptable growth rate
    * use for MOS transistor and dielectric components (use for dielectric layer)
    * low surface state charges (low defect) and thus make ideal dielectrics for MOS transistors
  
   </details>
   
   
   
   5. Isolation 
   
   <details><summary> Isolation </summary>
   
   * CMOS process need to be isolated from one another so that they do not have unexpected interactions.
   * The transistor gate consists of a thin gate oxide layer.
   * The thick oxide used to be formed by a process called Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS).
   * A problem with LOCOS-based processes is the transition between thick and thin oxide, which extended some distance laterally to form a so-called bird’s beak.
   * Starting around the 0.35 µm node, shallow trench isolation (STI) was introduced to avoid the problems with LOCOS.
   * STI forms insulating trenches of SiO2 surrounding the transistors (everywhere except the active area)
    
   </details>   
   
   
   
   6. Gate Oxide Creation 
   
   <details><summary> Gate Oxide </summary>
   
   * The next step is to form the gate oxide for the transistors. As mentioned, this is most commonly in the form of silicon dioxide (SiO2).The transistor gate             consists of a thin gate oxide layer
   * Relatively slowgrowth rates must be used to grow thin oxide films of precise thickness
   * use lower temperature at atm pressure (800 to 900 degree) or use lower than 10 atm pressure or using composite oxide films

   </details>   



   7. Gate and Source/Drain Formations
   
   <details><summary> Gate and Source/Drain Formations </summary>   
   
   * Grow gate oxide wherever transistors are required (area = source + drain + gate)
   * Deposit polysilicon on chip
   * Pattern polysilicon (both gates and interconnect)
   * Etch exposed gate oxide—i.e., the area of gate oxide where transistors are required that was not covered by polysilicon
   * Implant pMOS and nMOS source/drain regions
   
   </details> 
   
   
   
   8. Contacts and Metallization 
   
   <details><summary> Contacts and Metallization </summary>   
      
   * Contact cuts are made to source, drain, and gate according to the contact mask. 
   * Etch oxide where contact cuts are needed. These are holes etched in the dielectric after the source/drain formation.
   * Older processes commonly use aluminum (Al) for wires, although newer ones offer copper (Cu) for lower resistance.
   * Tungsten (W) can be used as a plug to fill the contact holes (to alleviate problems of aluminum not conforming to small contacts).,
   * Sputter on aluminium metal over whole wafer
   * pattern to remove excess metal, leaving wires
   
   </details> 
   
   
   
   9. Passivation
   
   <details><summary> Passivation </summary>    
   
   * The final processing step is to add a protective glass layer called passivation or over glass that prevents the ingress of contaminants.
   * Openings in the passivation layer, called overglass cuts, allow connection to I/O pads and test probe points if needed.

   </details> 
   
   
   
   10. Metrology
   
   <details><summary> Metrology </summary>    
   
   * Metrology is the science of measuring. Everything that is built in a semiconductor process has to be measured to give feedback to the manufacturing process.

* ##### **Fabrication Process**
   
   * **Step 1:** 
     * For N- well, a P-type silicon substrate is selected as a base for fabrication.
       
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259019-24347079-e183-41b3-9321-443baed27672.png)

	   
   * **Step 2 – Thermal Oxidation:** 
     * The selective diffusion of n-type impurities is accomplished using SiO2 as a barrier which protects portions of the wafer against contamination of the                substrate. SiO2 is laid out by oxidation process done exposing the substrate to high-quality oxygen and hydrogen in an oxidation chamber at approximately              10000c
     
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259036-30841c51-ed5e-41b9-bd5d-4ce916382263.png)
    
	   
   * **Step 3 – Growing of Photoresist:**
      * At this stage to permit the selective etching, the SiO2 layer is subjected to the photolithography process. In this process, the wafer is coated with a               uniform film of a photosensitive emulsion.
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259048-8b65aa6c-ab71-44f9-bbb7-7ca912fcf179.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 4 – Masking:** 
      * This step is the continuation of the photolithography process. In this step, a desired pattern of openness is made using a stencil. This stencil is used as a         mask over the photoresist. The substrate is now exposed to UV rays the photoresist present under the exposed regions of mask gets polymerized.
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259056-d54aab98-1a8d-4c1f-8f72-62b1c210b1ec.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 5 – Removal of Unexposed Photoresist:** 
      * The mask is removed and the unexposed region of photoresist is dissolved by developing wafer using a chemical such as Trichloroethylene
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259067-1a8d0d83-65cf-4cf1-bf6d-66ff3d926ca8.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 6 – Etching:** 
      * The wafer is immersed in an etching solution of hydrofluoric acid, which removes the oxide from the areas through which dopants are to be diffused
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259077-ed2fee4b-88c4-4f73-90fe-3a1780fac83d.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 7 – Removal of Whole Photoresist Layer:** 
      * During the etching process, those portions of SiO2 which are protected by the photoresist layer are not affected. The photoresist mask is now stripped off wit         chemical solvent (hot H2SO4)
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259089-58d5dcdb-b4e0-407d-aa0b-1a6e4b71f720.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 8 – Formation of N-well:** 
      * The n-type impurities are diffused into the p-type substrate through the exposed region thus forming an N- well
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259104-a1cd568b-a55d-4454-9331-f48b54cf4f8c.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 9 – Removal of SiO2:** 
      * The layer of SiO2 is now removed by using hydrofluoric acid
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259112-80d6c5b9-a3cd-4f32-81b7-f7d53add9c30.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 10 – Deposition of Polysilicon:** 
      * The misalignment of the gate of a CMOS transistor would lead to the unwanted capacitance which could harm circuit. So to prevent this “Self-aligned gate               process” is preferred where gate regions are formed before the formation of source and drain using ion implantation.

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259136-a4c16229-cdba-460d-9e1a-51a6d6b62b06.png)
       
      * Polysilicon is used for formation of the gate because it can withstand the high temperature greater than 80000c when a wafer is subjected to annealing methods 
      for formation of source and drain. Polysilicon is deposited by using Chemical Deposition Process over a thin layer of gate oxide. This thin gate oxide under the 
      Polysilicon layer prevents further doping under the gate region.

	   
   * **Step 11 – Formation of Gate Region:** 
      * Except the two regions required for formation of the gate for NMOS and PMOS transistors the remaining portion of Polysilicon is stripped off.

   * **Step 12 – Oxidation Process:** 
      * An oxidation layer is deposited over the wafer which acts as a shield for further diffusion and metallization processes.

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259493-d71bca98-498a-4202-9bf2-eac899ce408d.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 13 – Masking and Diffusion:** 
      * For making regions for diffusion of n-type impurities using masking process small gaps are made

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259503-631422cc-b356-46f4-aa17-ec016aa77bbd.png)
      
      * Using diffusion process three n+ regions are developed for the formation of terminals of NMOS.

   * **Step 14 – Removal of Oxide:** 
      The oxide layer is stripped off

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259537-24780a99-1c86-4bbb-a64d-196ef2f06f74.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 15 – P-type Diffusion:** 
      Similar to the n-type diffusion for forming the terminals of PMOS p-type diffusion are carried out

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259544-f5384f77-efb8-4661-98da-28e4589e769e.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 16 – Laying of Thick Field oxide:** 
      Before forming the metal terminals a thick field oxide is laid out to form a protective layer for the regions of the wafer where no terminals are required

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259549-03adfb06-85c8-44c0-bafe-345404245dbc.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 17 – Metallization:** 
      This step is used for the formation of metal terminals which can provide interconnections. Aluminum is spread on the whole wafer

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121996204/211259559-c300ea4b-61fb-42f1-bf9b-e77436dd4e3f.png)
      
	   
   * **Step 18 – Removal of Excess Metal:** 
      The excess metal is removed from the wafer.

	   
   * **Step 19 – Formation of Terminals:** 
      In the gaps formed after removal of excess metal terminals are formed for the interconnections.

   <details><summary> Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) Isolation Process </summary>   
   
#### **Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) Isolation Process**
   
* **Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS)** is the traditional isolation technique used in submicron processes.


    1. A very thin layer silicon dioxide is grown on the wafer, called as pad oxide. Then a layer of silicon nitride is deposited which is used as an oxide barrier.
    2. Then photolithography is done to pattern and etch the nitride and pad oxide where the thick oxide will be grown
    3. Then by thermal oxidation process thick oxide is grown in the exposed area.
    4. The last step is the removal of the silicon nitride layer.

|      **Limitation**     |     **Advantages**      | 
|  ---------------    | ------------------- | 
|  the bird’s beak effect and the surface area which is lost to this encroachment  | simple process flow and high oxide quality because the whole LOCOS structure is thermally grown  |
|  the restricted bird’s beak leads to undesirable stress effects in the transistor.    |    |

   <details><summary> Shallow trench isolation (STI) process </summary>    
   
   #### **Shallow trench isolation (STI)**   

* **Sallow Trench Isolation (STI)** isolation process is the preferred isolation process for deep-submicron process because it allows closer spacing of transistors by eliminating the depletion region at the surface and it completely avoids Bird’s beak shape characteristics due to LOCOS process.


   0. The STI process starts in the same way as the LOCOS process
   1. Cover the wafer with pad oxide and silicon nitride.
   2. First etch nitride and pad oxide. Next, an anisotropic etch is made in the silicon to a depth of 0.4 to 0.5 microns.
   3. Grow a thin thermal oxide layer on the trench walls the so-called as liner oxide.But unlike with LOCOS, the thermal oxidation process is stopped after the             formation of a thin oxide layer.
   4. A CVD dielectric film is used to fill the trench.
   5. A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) step is used to polish back the dielectric layer until the nitride is reached. The nitride acts like a CMP stop layer.
   6. Densify the dielectric material at 900°C and strip the nitride and pad oxide

   * Also an implant can be applied to create a higher-doped region beneath the channels to prevent punch-through from the drain depletion region extending to source      depletion region.

   <details><summary> 6. Sidewall spacer </summary>
   
   * A layer of dielectric is deposited on the surface and removed in such a way as to leave “sidewall spacers” next to the thin-oxide-polysilicon-polycide sandwich. 
   * These sidewall spacers will prevent the part of the source and drain next to the channel from becoming heavily doped

   <details><summary> 8. Siliciding (Salicide and Polycide) </summary>
   
   * This step reduces the resistance of the bulk diffusions and polysilicon and forms an ohmic contact with material on which it is deposited.
   * Salicide = Self-aligned silicide

   <details><summary> 11. Top level metal, vias and protective oxide </summary>
   
   * The previous step is repeated for the second-level metal.
   * After multiple levels of metal are applied, the fabrication is completed with a thicker top level metal and a protective layer to hermetically seal the circuit        from the environment.
   * metal is used for the upper level metal vias. The chip is electrically connected by removing the protective layer over large bonding pads

   <details><summary>  MOS Capacitor </summary> 
	   
* **Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) Junction**

1. MOS junction simply a capacitor
2. No current-voltage relationship, only capacitor-voltage relationship 

	   
| Metal  |used polysilicon that is used as a gate| 	   
|  ---------------    | ------------------- | 	   
|  **Insulator**  | **that is used is silicon dioxide (SiO2) which we call as Oxide** | 
|  **Semiconductor**  | **that is used is silicon** | 
	   
	   
	  
* Also call as MOSCAP
  * M - O - S  = Metal - Oxide - Semiconductor
  * CAP = because the oxide which is insulator is sandwich between a conductor and semiconductor which will act as capacitor

|      **Ideal**     | 
|  ---------------    | 
|  the work function of metal and semiconductor are the same = 0  |  
|  Oxide has no charges inside or the oxide is free of charges  |  
|  the substrate is uniformly doped  |  
|  Oxide has infinite resisitivity which mean there cannot be current flowing through the oxide when we do the operation  |

   <details><summary> Priciple of operation </summary> 
	   
* The four modes of operation of an MOS structure:
1. Case1: (V < 0) = Accumulation
2. Case2: (V > 0) = Depletion and weak inversion
3. Case3: (V ≥ VT) = Strong inversion
4. Flat-band and Threshold voltage	   
	   
   <details><summary> Accumulation </summary> 
	   
   **Accumulation Mode (V < 0):**
	
   * below the flatband voltage, VFB is called as Accumulation mode of operation			 
   * Pile of majority carrier at the interface
   * Charge at the surface directly proportional to voltage	
   * Accumulation occurs typically for -ve voltages where the -ve charge on the gate attracts holes from the substrate to the oxide-semiconductor interface.

   </details>
	   
   <details><summary> Depletion </summary> 

   * between the flatband voltage and the threshold voltage, VT is called as Depletion mode of operation 
   * Depletion occurs for positive voltages.
   * The +ve charge on the gate pushes the mobile holes into the substrate.
   * Therefore, the semiconductor is depleted of mobile carriers at the interface and a -ve charge, due to the ionized acceptor ions, is left in the space charge region	
	   
   </details>
	   
   <details><summary> Inversion </summary> 
   
   * larger than the threshold voltage is called as Inversion mode of operation   
	   
   </details>
	   
   <details><summary> Threshold voltage and Flat-band </summary> 
	   
   * Flatband conditions exist when no charge is present in the semiconductor so that the Si energy band is flat
