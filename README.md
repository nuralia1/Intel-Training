### **Notes- Fundamentals of VLSI Design and overview of Sand-to-Silicon**

   <details><summary> Moore's Law </summary> 

   #### **Moore's Law**
* **Moore's Law** - Number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. We can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years but we will pay less for them.

   #### **FPGA VS ASIC**
* **FPGA** - is a multipurpose microchip you can reprogram for multiple applications
* **ASIC** - is designed for a specific application 


|                   |     FPGA      |   ASIC      |
|  -------------    | ------------- | ----------- |
|  Time to Market   |     Fast      |    Slow     |

   #### **Full custom design vs semi custom design**

|                Full custom design                    |                                      Semi custom design                                     |
|  ------------------------------------------------    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All mask layers are customised in full custom design | It uses pre-designed logic cell (AND gates, OR gate, multiplexers) known as standard cells |
|         Design time and complexity is higher         |                             Design time and complexity is lower                             |
|                 higher performance                   |                                       low performance                                       |
|                      low cost                        |                                         high cost                                           | 
|       less dependency on existing technology         |                       complete dependency on existing technology                            | 
|   entire design is made without use of any library   |                  design is completed with the use of multiple library                       |
